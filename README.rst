CKAN extension to restrict the accessibility to the resources of a dataset.
This way the package metadata is accesible but not the data itself (resource). 
The resource access restriction level can be individualy defined for every package.

Users can request access to a dataset by pressing a button and filling up a simple form. The package owner can
allow individual users to access the resource. If the users allowed individually 
will be notified by mail. It also includes notifying by mail on every new user registration that can be disabled (expained later in this document). The mails are generated from templates that can be extended.

All information inside the restricted fields (except 'level') is hidden for users other than the ones who can edit the dataset. We used this to keep a shared-secret key field for accessing remotely hosted resources (https://github.com/EnviDat/ckanext-envidat_theme/blob/4265ecfe90e10eb1f095e8e8d19fe43554ab6799/ckanext/envidat_theme/helpers.py#L28). 
The allowed usernames are hidden partially to the non-editors, in our case was critical because they were very similar to the user emails (https://github.com/EnviDat/ckanext-restricted/blob/2d7b2915ef50249fe8d9ec43ceaf532918506539/ckanext/restricted/action.py#L153).

Requirements
------------

This extension has been oruginally developed for CKAN version 2.5.2 and is compatible up to 2.8.x.

Requires the following extensions:
* ckanext-scheming
* ckanext-repeating
* ckanext-composite

YOu can find an alternative without scheming here https://github.com/olivierdalang/ckanext-restricted/commit/89693f5e4a2a4dedf2cada289d1bf46bd7991069 

The resource access restriction level can be individualy defined for every package. This requires adding an extra field to package metadata with (some of) the possible values: "public",  "registered", "any_organization",  "same_organization" (as the package).

The allowed user list is also defined in an additional field that includes autocomplete.

If you use ckanext-scheming and ckanext-composite, this is the field definition in JSON:
::
     {
     "scheming_version": 1,
     "dataset_type": "dataset",
     "about": "",
     "about_url": "http://github.com/ckan/ckanext-scheming",
     "dataset_fields": [...],
     "resource_fields": [
      [...]
       {
       "field_name": "restricted",
       "label": "Access Restriction",
       "preset": "composite",
       "subfields":
        [
          {
            "field_name": "level",
            "label": "Level",
            "preset": "select",
            "form_include_blank_choice": false,
            "required": true,
            "choices": [
              {
                "value": "public",
                "label": "Public"
              },
              {
                "value": "registered",
                "label": "Registered Users"
              },
              {
                "value": "any_organization",
                "label": "Any Organization Members (Trusted Users)"
              },
              {
                "value": "same_organization",
                "label": "Same Organization Members"
               },
               {
                "value": "only_allowed_users",
                "label": "Allowed Users Only"
              }
             ]
           },
            {
            "field_name": "allowed_users",
             "label": "Allowed Users",
             "preset": "tag_string_autocomplete",
             "data-module-source":"/api/2/util/user/autocomplete?q=?"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }

The usage of this extension, regarding the level "any_organization", makes more sense if the CKAN administrator sets some users as members of an organization. In our case we created an organization called "trusted_users" where the mail accounts have been double checked. Therefore this extension sends a mail to the defined 'mail_to' in the CKAN config file at every new user registration. To switch off this functionality, just comment out the code at:  
https://github.com/espona/ckanext-restricted/blob/master/ckanext/restricted/plugin.py#L14

It is also recommended to set up the recaptcha in the config file
     # Restricted
     ckan.recaptcha.version = 2
     ckan.recaptcha.privatekey = 6LeQxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdN82ojuQAgBd
     ckan.recaptcha.publickey =  6LeQxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdN82ojuQAgBd

The for mail notifications, the mail_to and smtp options in the ini file have to be configured. Please take a look to the following documentation: 

- http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#email-settings
- http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/email-notifications.html

Installation
------------

.. Add any additional install steps to the list below.
   For example installing any non-Python dependencies or adding any required
   config settings.

To install ckanext-restricted:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Install the ckanext-restricted Python package into your virtual environment::

     pip install ckanext-restricted

3. Add ``restricted`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload


---------------
Config Settings
---------------

Only the scheming configuration is needed (JSON file defining your schema).

steps:

1. Create a source distribution of the project::

     python setup.py sdist

2. Register the project::

     python setup.py register

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the first release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.1 then do::

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags
